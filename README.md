# Quantum Computing with Qiskit - README

## Overview
Welcome to the **Quantum Computing with Qiskit** repository! This repository contains a collection of quantum computing projects, experiments, and educational code examples created using **Qiskit**, an open-source quantum computing software development framework. It serves as a resource for learning, experimenting, and understanding quantum algorithms, quantum gates, and error correction techniques.

## Features
- **Quantum Algorithms**: Implementation of popular quantum algorithms like Grover's Search, Shor's algorithm, and the Quantum Fourier Transform.
- **Quantum Circuits**: Example quantum circuits showcasing basic and advanced gate operations.
- **Error Correction**: Examples demonstrating error correction techniques for maintaining qubit integrity.
- **Tutorials and Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step tutorials to learn Qiskit and quantum computing concepts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or later
- Qiskit (`pip install qiskit`)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, recommended for running the tutorials)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qiskit-quantum-computing.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd qiskit-quantum-computing
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
